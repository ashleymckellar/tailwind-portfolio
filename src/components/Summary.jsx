                In my technical and customer support career, I've honed my
                skills in handling diverse clients and complex technical
                challenges, emphasizing empathy, effective communication, and
                problem-solving. I recently completed a full stack JavaScript
                certification at V School, specializing in the MERN stack. Since
                completing my certification, I've been actively engaged as a
                member of a developer team at V School, participating in weekly
                scrums, and completing internship projects for clients under a
                project manager. I'm now seeking my first full-time role as a
                front-end or full-stack developer.
