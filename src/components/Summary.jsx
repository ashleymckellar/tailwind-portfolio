                Hi, I'm Ashley and I'm a Seattle-area software developer
                looking to make an impact on your team. With a background in
                full-stack software development utilizing the MERN stack, I've
                also developed apps using Firebase and Supabase, and I also have
                experience with NextJS. I'm eager to add new libraries,
                frameworks, and languages to my knowledge base. I'm a master
                debugger, troubleshooter, and decipherer of documentation, and I
                currently serve as a teaching assistant at V School's full stack
                development program.
            </p>
